      <h2>Specialised assessments</h2>
      <p>
        Get a mental health assessments in the primary care setting – this means
        that when going to the GP regarding an issue or concern regarding mental
        health, but feel limited by the time restrictions in place, I can offer
        a more detailed specialised assessment to provide GPs with a treatment
        recommendation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This service is ideal for those that feel they have on-going mental
        health problems but are able to continue functioning – in the sense that
        a person can keeping on ticking by but they feel as though there is some
        lack of clarity regarding their mental health, or options to resolve
        these.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, though I offer a broad service, I cannot provide formal
        ADHD assessments or ASD diagnosis, though we can discuss these.
