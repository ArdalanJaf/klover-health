      <p>
        I am a Specialty Doctor in Psychiatry with 9 years experience, having
        worked in General Adult Psychiatry and all of the sub-specialties of
        psychiatry. For the last three years I have worked for the NHS in a
        London Borough Crisis Team. Having worked throughout the Global Pandemic
        from 2020 into 2022, particularly in a heavily under resourced
        circumstance, I was able to hone my skills in assessing and formulating
        Mental Health disorders in a pressured environment, and facilitating
        appropriate care using the most accessible approach.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        This project has come about to relieve the pressure primary healthcare
        and community mental health services are facing in ever-more pressurised
        times. My pricing is a reflection of my belief that this should not have
        to be an option for people who should be able to utilise services fully
        from the NHS, (THIS IS CONFUSING BECAUSE IT IS NOT CHEAP PRICING) but as
        a means of translating the symptoms of a mental health disorder into a
        clearer direction for both GPs and CMHTs to be directed from. This
        service is wholly designed to accelerate access to the most suitable
        care.
